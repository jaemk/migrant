> Basic migration manager powered by [`migrant_lib`](https://github.com/jaemk/migrant_lib)


**Supported databases/features:**

| Feature       |    Backend                            |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| `postgres`    | Enable postgres connectivity          |
| `sqlite`      | Enable sqlite connectivity            |
| `mysql`       | Enable mysql connectivity             |
| `update`      | Enable `self-update` functionality    |


`migrant` will manage all migrations that live under `<project-dir>/migrations/`, where `project-dir` is the closest
parent path that contains a `Migrant.toml` configuration file (`..../<project-dir>/Migrant.toml`).
The default migration file location can be modified in your `Migrant.toml` file (`"migration_location"`).
If the `migration_location` directory doesn't exist, it will be created the first time you create a new migration.
`migrant` stores all applied migrations in a database table named `__migrant_migrations`.

*Note:* Configuration values prefixed with `env:` in your `Migrant.toml` will be sourced from environment variables.
For example, `database_user = "env:DB_USER"` will use the value of the environment variable `DB_USER`.
If a `.env.` file exists, it will be "sourced" automatically before your `Migrant.toml` is loaded.

*Note:* SQL statements are batch executed as is. If you want your migration to happen atomically in a
transaction you must manually wrap your statements in a transaction (`begin transaction; ... commit;`).


### Installation

**Binary releases:**

See [releases](https://github.com/jaemk/migrant/releases) for binaries. If you've already installed a binary release, you can update to the latest release via `migrant self update`.

**Building from source:**

By default `migrant` will build without any features, falling back to using each database's `cli` commands
(`psql` / `sqlite3` / `mysqlsh`).
The `postgres`, `rusqlite`, and `mysql` database driver libraries can be activated with their respective feature flags.
Note, Some drivers require their dev libraries (`postgresql`: `libpq-dev`, `sqlite`: `libsqlite3-dev`).
[Self update](https://github.com/jaemk/self_update) functionality (updating to the latest GitHub release) is available behind the `update` feature.
The binary releases are built with all features.

**Building from source (`crates.io`):**

```shell
# install without features
# use cli commands for all db interaction
cargo install migrant

# install with `postgres`
cargo install migrant --features postgres

# install with `rusqlite`
cargo install migrant --features sqlite

# all
cargo install migrant --features 'postgres sqlite mysql update'
```

### Simple Usage

`migrant init [--type <database-type>, --location <project-dir>, --no-confirm]` - Initialize project by creating a `Migrant.toml` file with db info/credentials.
When run interactively (without `--no-confirm`), `setup` will be run automatically.

`migrant setup` - Verify database info/credentials and setup a `__migrant_migrations` table if missing.

`migrant new <tag>` - Generate new up & down files with the given `<tag>` under the specified `migration_location`.

`migrant edit <tag> [--down]` - Edit the `up` [or `down`] migration file with the given `<tag>`.

`migrant list` - Display all available .sql files and mark those applied.

`migrant apply [--down, --all, --force, --fake]` - Apply the next available migration[s].

`migrant shell` - Open a repl

`migrant which-config` - Display the full path of the `Migrant.toml` file being used

`migrant connect-string` - Display either the connection-string generated from config-params or the database-path for sqlite

`migrant self update` - Update to the latest version released on GitHub.

`migrant self bash-completions install [--path <path>]` - Generate a bash completion script and save it to the default or specified path.


### Usage as a library

See [`migrant_lib`](https://github.com/jaemk/migrant_lib) and
[examples](https://github.com/jaemk/migrant_lib/tree/master/examples).
`migrant` itself is just a thin wrapper around `migrant_lib`, so the full functionality of migration management
can be embedded in your actual project.
